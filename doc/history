Significant internal overhaul, probably fixing many unknown bugs and corner
cases.

It is a breaking change in that callbacks now only have a single option argument
and they should declare the other number types that they rely on, for example
this:

~~~ruby
config.softbins do |bin|
  bin * 5
end
~~~

should now be changed to this:

~~~ruby
config.softbin needs: :bin do |options|
  options[:bin] * 5
end
~~~

Added capability to use ranges per test for Bins/Softbins and Test Numbers.
It is recommended to follow the contraints that Bins get configured first, followed by
Softbins and numbers.

Added test\_ids:clear command to clear the database.

Added the ability for the test number to be referenced in a softbin algorithm,
e.g. here to set the softbin to the same as the test number:

~~~ruby
TestIds.configure do |config|
  config.bins.include << (1..3)
  config.softbins.algorithm = :nnnn
  config.numbers.include << (8000..9000)
end

Now supports independent assignment of bin, softbin and test numbers, allowing for example
multiple instances of the same test to have the same bin but unique test numbers.

Also now supports reserving multiple numbers per test instead of only 1.

Fixed bug whereby setting a number to :none would result in the existing allocation being
lost from the store.

Added test\_ids:rollback command to allow easy rollback of the store in the event of a bad
commit/run being made.

Updated the store checkout/in process to do a better job of preventing merges between
different workspaces. If a merge occurs it can result in lost bin refs, this should
prevent merges ever occurring.

Added option to supply a :test\_id key. When present, this will be used by test\_ids
to identify the test instead of the name used within the test program, causing all
tests with the same ID to use the same numbers:

~~~ruby
func :my\_func\_33mhz, test\_id: :my\_func  # Will all be treated like the same test by test\_ids,
func :my\_func\_25mhz, test\_id: :my\_func  # and will therefore all be assigned the same numbers
func :my\_func\_16mhz, test\_id: :my\_func
